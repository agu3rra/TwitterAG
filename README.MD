 ## Learning Objectives
 - Configure an iOS application's user interface entirely in code (without the use of Storyboards).
 - Import and use a 3rd party library thru CocoaPods: http://cocoapods.org . This app uses LBTAComponents in order to facilitate the building of CollectionView based application and TRON for parsing JSON files.

## Attention
The tutorial doesn't cover the Social Framework in order to connect to a Twitter account.
